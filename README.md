In the Python folder there is a project.py file.
This file is a data-storing assistant template which is meant to help others build upon it. It is a very basic program that can store data, add data, update data, and exit the program. The program runs infintely unless the exit function is executed.
Enjoy building upon this basic program. Thanks a lot!
